title: Web Components!
---

Web components are a mind-boggling concept for someone who just begun understanding HTML and CSS not so long ago.  Yet, web components offers an exiting preview of what the web could and will be in a near future, which I’m all for! Understanding web components is not easy and especially for someone who barely understand JavaScript. Luckily web developers are kind enough to share and explain complex concepts and emerging technologies with the rest, which allows the industry as a whole to advance as fast as the web. Upon seeing Mr. Biderman lecture I’m convince that web components will play an important role in the web in a near future. 

The whole idea of defining a new HTML element tag is amazing, and with this feature a lot of possibilities are created. For example, now developers can be real specific of how they name their custom HTML tags , just like the video tag wraps a video source per say, a custom HTML tag would follow the same kind of specifics. Elements can now be named based on their function, which is pretty cool!

Another idea that I found interesting was the idea of reusing code by using HTML import that web components offer and by using HTML imports developers can use other people’s work to further develop the web. After, all isn’t the web considered a collaborating that many people made possible?
