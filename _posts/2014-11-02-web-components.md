title: Web Components!
---

Web Components is a mind-boggling concept for someone who just begun to understand HTML and CSS not so long ago.  Yet, Web Components offer an exciting preview of what the web could and will be in a near future, which I’m all for! 

Understanding Web Components is not easy and especially for someone who barely understands JavaScript. Luckily web developers are kind enough to share and explain complex concepts and emerging technologies with the rest, which allows the industry as a whole to advance. Upon seeing Mr. Bidelman’s lecture, I’m convince that Web Components will play an important role in the web in a near future because of its powerful components: templates, custom elements, shadow DOM, and HTML imports. 

The whole idea of defining a new HTML element tag is amazing, and with this feature a lot of possibilities are created. For example, now developers can be real specific of how they name their custom HTML tags, just like the video tag wraps a video source per say, a custom HTML tag would follow the same kind of specifics. These custom elements can now be named based on their function, which is pretty cool! 

HTML Imports is another cool feature found in Web Components that I found interesting and quite useful. HTML imports allow developers to reuse and include HTML documents in other HTML documents. Now developers can work on stuff and others can use the same work to further enhance their own work, thus help advance the whole web itself. After all isn’t the web considered a collaboration that many people made possible?
