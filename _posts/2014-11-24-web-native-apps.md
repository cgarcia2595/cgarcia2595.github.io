title: Web apps vs Native apps
---
One of the things I really enjoy about web development is how fast paced the field is. Everyday a new technology is being developed which makes the web an exciting place to discover ideas and concepts that could potentially inspire a web developer to create something great. HTML5 and CSS3 are two great technologies that are becoming increasingly powerful with the addition of other languages like JavaScript.  These languages can be use in a very powerful way that can compete with native apps in a near future. 

However, it seems to me based on the reading I’ve done regarding this topic that the battles versus web apps and native apps is increasingly becoming a one sided battle. 
I believe that many developers based on my observations are people who love to be in control. Many developers who defend web apps argue that web apps are better because they have more control of what they can do with their product. 
As opposed to a native app that lives either in the app store or a user device which gives them more control of the application more than the developer would of like. If the user does not update the application then the app can become unresponsive in the user device while a web app can be updated constantly and the user wouldn’t know. 

Ultimately I think it all comes down to money, control, and workload. Lets face it no one wants to put in extra work for a couple of bucks more, it doesn’t make sense to do so. Personally, as a user I enjoy what a native app offers to me, I like the fact that I can download the application in my phone and access the app by touching the icon in my home screen. As a developer I would love to have more control over the applications I develop and so I would argue that web apps is the way to go. As of now I have to say that native apps are winning the battle do to how the world is using the web currently. If developers find a way to make web apps more accessible to the user then perhaps web apps may have a chance of competing with native apps.  

I honestly think it would be beneficial to learn how to develop for both web and native apps. I mean, learning how to code in HTML5, and CSS3 is not difficult at all.  However, if I had to choose one I would advice someone to learn how to develop for web apps because the same technology can be use to develop other things. Overall, I believe the one winning this battle is the user because the user is the one who decides what fails and what becomes a hit. Our job as developers depend on what the consumer wants and it’s asking for we can only pray that the user understand what’s best.
