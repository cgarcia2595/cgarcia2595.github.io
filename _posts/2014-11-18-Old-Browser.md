title: Older Browsers
---

Internet Explorer, every developer worst nightmare! Should developers ditch old versions of Internet Explore, heck yeah! I believe people are using old versions of Internet Explorer because they simply do not know any better. I mean, if the browser works and does what you want it to do, why stop using it? Another reason may be that people simply learned that the E icon accesses the Internet, and thus ignoring the fact they may have other alternatives available to them. 

Lets face it Explorer hasn’t got any better since 2000s and I believe a possible explanation for this may be because developers still spend time coding for these older versions.  If the development community “boycotted” Explorer I believe Microsoft may kick start Explorer and get it back on track. If web pages begin to break in Explorer people using these browser won’t be able to access these site thus creating a call to action. 

Sadly, I don’t see developers “boycotting” Explorer. It’s simply a matter of pride. I find that developers have this love and hate relationship with Explorer. I believe the reason for this may be because developers want to feed their ego by coding for these browser. How, you may ask? Well, if you can code for older versions of Internet Explorer successfully aren’t you the best? Wouldn’t the satisfaction of coding something somewhat challenging feed a developer ego?  Should we blame developers for feeding into this problem that should have been killed long time ago?

I believe a possible solution for this problem could be in a form of a warning sign, prompting the user to download the newer of version of Explorer. Yet, this wont totally fixed the problem with Explorer but I think we would be heading in the right direction.
