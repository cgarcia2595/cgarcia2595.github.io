## Why I'm Here

My thirst for learning about new things pushed me to pursue a career in the field of design. I love challenges; I believe a good challenge can help anyone grow as an individual because it forces you to solve a problem. Since I was a little kid my brain always tried to connect the dots, in the end, only one thing matter: my brain always demanded some type of logic behind everything I learned. 

Design changed my world in various ways, but like in every world life changes, so does graphic design. That is how web development came into my life. I figured that I needed to find a middle ground between technology and design if I wanted to keep up with the changes occurring within the industry. Designing and coding for the web is a different experience than designing for print. Yet, I have found that that designing for these two different mediums has allowed me to express my concepts and ideas in ways I have never imagined. The beauty of web design is that concepts and ideas can come to life in a unique and interesting way Iâ€™m not stuck to paper ink anymore. Finding different ways to solve creative problems in a unique and interesting way without losing my identity as a designer is important to me.
