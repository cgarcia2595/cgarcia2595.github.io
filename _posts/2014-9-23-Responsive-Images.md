# Responsive Images Why Are They Important!

Human beings are visual creatures and we tend to gravitate towards visuals rather than words. Humans are self-centered, always asking what is there for me. So the role of the developer and designer is to create an experience that will create visually appealing websites with good content for the user. 

Responsive images are a crucial part of a website’s success. Just picture a site full of blocks of text would you bother reading it? Wouldn’t you get a headache from reading so much content without allowing your eyes a rest? I’m sure there’s a way to showcase images in web design and sure there is!

You can implement responsive images by using CSS or using a Picturefill. 

This is how to implement responsive images by using CSS


```
.someclass {
        background-image: url('image.jpg');
        height:400px;
}
```

```
<header class="someclass">
  <h1>some-text</h1>
</header>

```
