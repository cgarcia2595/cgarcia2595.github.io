title: NYT Article!
---

Who knew reading an article online can be so much fun. After all I’m one of those people who swears that books are not dead. Upon reading The New York Times (NYT): A Game of Shark and Minnow I have to reconsider what technology can do for readers. I think what I like about books is the fact that I can interact with the pages in different ways from highlighting to folding pages, something you can’t do when you are reading online. 

If only online articles and e-books somehow became interactive somehow like the NYT article it would win me over. The NYT article is great in many ways, the content is good, the visuals are amazing, and the layout is easy to follow. These characteristics create an experience that often times are neglected in books, e-books, and online articles unless you vividly create an experience in your mind. The NYT article manages to create an experience with the visuals, the sound, and the content for their reader out of a long article that could potentially be boring. 

I also enjoyed how the designer designed the article to display correctly in different devices. Although I missed the parallax scrolling effect when browsing in mobile I understand why it was omitted. Overall the page is well balanced and well designed, which allows the viewer to fully enjoy the art
