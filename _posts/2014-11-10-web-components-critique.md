title: Web Components and its future
---

Many professionals take pride in their work and especially if they are truly dedicated and passionate about what they do. Many simply enjoy the daily struggles and challenges their job throws at them. Perhaps, we expect all that and much more. Yet, we all love a good “freebie,” don’t we? If someone comes and tells you, “Hey, I have something that will make your job easier,” wouldn’t you take it? 

Web Components is one of those “freebies” that web developers are currently exploring and using. Templates, shadow DOM, and custom elements are three of the four components that makes this “freebie” very attractive. These three components allow developers to share, built, and change the way the web is being built. Although Web Components are truly magical in every sense of the word I see major trouble attached to them. For example, templates are being used more and more by developers and yet how many people have coded the template by hand? After all it wouldn’t be called a template if everyone were coding the template each time someone uses it! This leads me to ask, would we call ourselves web developers if half of our work were copy and paste? Is like me taking Picasso’s famous blue era painting, The old Guitarist, and adding an extra paint stroke, and then claiming the piece as mine because I added an extra element that in my opinion made the piece better. It simply doesn’t make sense! Don’t get me wrong, I truly believe in collaboration, but when you give humans an easy way out many will take advantage of it without thinking of the consequences that can lead to. 

Many things will be sacrificed if we take advantage of this path. Many will lose credibility, respect, and perhaps even their jobs. Yet, I also can make the argument that the industry may gain their creativity back; the less coding there is more time to create awesome pieces of work. Every good thing has a bad side and its up to us to make the best choices that would eventually take us to the next level.
